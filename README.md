# ComputerVision
A comprehensive CV tutorial of the principles of visual recognition and artifical intelligence

## What you should expect?
In this repository you'll find a technical depth introduction to the wonderful field of CV; what are the current day technologies and how to use them

**We won't cover everything**

For now, you won't find the historical  background nor the mathematical insides of the systems beyond a functional perspective. I'll try to cover only what is needed, but I can't promise this will cover a full understanding of the topics. 

**The topics that will be covered**

- The tasks of computer vision: Classification, detection, and segmentation.
- Clustering and representation
- Classification
- Deep learning

**Acknowledgments**

Thank you so much to PhD Pablo Arbelaéz Escalante for providing the knowledge I'm presenting on this course along many university courses
