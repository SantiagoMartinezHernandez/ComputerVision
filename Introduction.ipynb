The course is based on [Pablo Arbelaéz Escalante's](https://academia.uniandes.edu.co/AcademyCv/pa.arbelaez) courses: Preprocessing and image analysis for biomedical engineering and principles of visual recognition. Along with Advanced Machine learning: Tiny & Simple, and many other lectures I have been given throughout my careers. \n",
